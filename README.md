<h1> Youtube suscription button </h1>

use this widget to display a youtube subscription button to your youtube channel or any
other channel in your website

From the WP API we took the boilerplate for the plugins in general
and pasted it in a class called  'Youtube_Subs_Widget' that extends the 
'WP_Widget' class to inherit the wordpress properties and methods...

we made some customizaitons to place some form fields that are displayed in the 
wordpress plugins dashboard / 'youtube subs' "our plugin" to let the user choose the channel..
change the button layout...choose to show the subscriptions count or now and so on...
